# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

• Implemented and compared various Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as Deep Q-Network, Dueling Double DQN, Proximal Policy Optimization and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient.

• Explore their performance on discrete action spaces (LunarLander-v2 and PongDeterministic-v4) and continuous action spaces (Open AI's PyBullet and Atari).
